      I’m <strong>Fardeen</strong> — I design AI-powered products with a strong
      focus on clarity, usability, and trust.

  <section id="about" class="section">
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I started by building software and AI systems that worked correctly,
        but often felt confusing to real users.
      </p>
      <p>
        That gap between intelligence and usability led me to UI/UX design.
        Today, I focus on simplifying complexity and designing experiences
        that feel calm, clear, and human.

      Designing trust and responsibility in a medical AI assistant.

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Medical information is overwhelming and filled with jargon.
          Users seeking guidance are already anxious.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Users</h3>
        <p>
          Non-technical users who need quick, understandable medical guidance
          and clear next steps.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>The UX Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          How can AI provide medical insights without increasing fear
          or confusion?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>
          Conversational flow, step-by-step information, and a calm visual
          hierarchy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>
          A Medical AI Bot that guides users through symptoms, provides insights,
          recommends drugs, and checks interactions using simple language.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="case-card">
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          In healthcare, good UX is ethical. Clarity and empathy matter as much
          as accuracy.
        </p>
