  <section id="about">
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
      I began my journey building software and AI systems.  
      The logic worked, the outputs were correct — but I noticed something missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many products fail not because the technology is weak,
      but because users feel confused, overwhelmed, or unsure.
    </p>
    <p>
      That curiosity led me to UI/UX design.
      Today, I focus on clarity, empathy, and thoughtful decision-making —
      especially when designing complex systems like AI and healthcare tools.

  <section id="medical-ai">
    <h2>Case Study — Medical AI Bot</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      Designing trust, clarity, and responsibility in a medical AI assistant.
    </p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Medical information is overwhelming and often filled with jargon.
      Users seeking guidance are usually anxious, and poorly designed interfaces
      can increase fear instead of reducing it.
    </p>

    <h3>Understanding the Users</h3>
    <p>
      The primary users were non-technical individuals looking for quick,
      understandable medical guidance. Their main concerns were trust,
      clarity, and knowing what to do next.
    </p>

    <h3>The UX Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      How can an AI system provide medical insights without overwhelming users
      or making them feel unsafe?
    </p>

    <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
    <p>
      I focused on a simple conversational flow, step-by-step information delivery,
      and calm visual hierarchy to reduce cognitive load.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
      The Medical AI Bot guides users through symptoms, provides possible condition
      insights, recommends drugs, and checks interactions — all using clear,
      human-friendly language.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      This project reinforced that in healthcare, good UX is not optional.
      Clear communication and empathy are as important as accuracy.
