  <section id="about" class="about reveal">
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
      I started my journey by building software and AI systems.
      The logic worked — but I kept asking myself:
      <em>would a real person understand this?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      That question pushed me toward UI/UX design.
      Today, I work at the intersection of technology and empathy,
      designing experiences that simplify complexity and feel human.

    <h2>Medical AI Bot</h2>
    <p class="case-intro">
      Designing trust, clarity, and calm in a medical AI assistant.
    </p>

    <div class="case-block morph">
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Medical information is overwhelming and filled with jargon.
        Users seeking guidance are often anxious, and poor UX increases confusion.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-block morph">
      <h3>Understanding the Users</h3>
      <p>
        Non-technical users looking for quick, understandable medical guidance.
        Their biggest needs were clarity, trust, and reassurance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-block morph">
      <h3>The UX Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        How can an AI system provide insights without overwhelming
        or frightening users?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-block morph">
      <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
      <p>
        A conversational flow, minimal UI, and step-by-step information
        to reduce cognitive load and anxiety.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-block morph">
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        A Medical AI Bot that guides users through symptoms,
        provides condition insights, drug recommendations,
        and interaction checks in simple language.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-block morph">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This project taught me that in healthcare,
        good UX is not optional — it is ethical.
